# Telegram Mini Apps React Boilerplate

This boilerplate demonstrates how developers can implement a single-page application on the Telegram
Mini Apps platform using the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TON Connect](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/overview)
- [@tma.js SDK](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/tma-js-sdk)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

> This boilerplate was created using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Therefore, it is recommended to use
> it for this project as well.
